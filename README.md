# Spotify-Recommendation-system-Using-LightFM-
This project involves building a music recommendation system using the Spotify Playlists dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes user interactions with various artists, which is processed to create a user-item interaction matrix. The recommendation model is built using LightFM, a matrix factorization-based algorithm optimized for implicit feedback. The data is first preprocessed by filtering out artists with fewer than 50 interactions and users who have interacted with fewer than 10 unique artists. The interaction matrix is constructed with user IDs and artist IDs, representing the frequency of interactions. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using LightFMâ€™s cross-validation module. The model is trained using the Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss function, which is well-suited for ranking-based recommendations. Performance is evaluated using AUC score and precision at k, showing how well the model ranks relevant recommendations. Finally, a sample recommendation function is implemented to generate artist recommendations for specific users based on their past listening behavior. The results indicate that the system effectively identifies relevant artists, demonstrating the effectiveness of matrix factorization in personalized music recommendations.
